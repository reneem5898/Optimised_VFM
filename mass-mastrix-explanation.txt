Notes on lumped mass matrix versus consistent mass matrix in Abaqus:

Theory Manual
2.4.1
v. 6.11

The definition of the mass matrix introduced above is the consistent mass: the mass matrix obtained by consistent use of the interpolation. 
The first-order elements in Abaqus all use lumped mass, where the mass matrix is a diagonal matrix. The lumped matrix is obtained by adding 
each row of the consistent matrix onto the diagonal. For these first-order elements the lumped mass matrix gives more accurate results in 
numerical experiments that calculate the natural frequencies of simple models.
